        <div class="story-content">
            <p>This story is derived from an early morning dream I had during Brahma Muhurtam, the meaning of which I am still pondering. My dream began with a scene of a boy picking up a small chick while a hen pecked at him, trying to deter him from harming her offspring.</p>

            <p>Initially, I wanted to shoo the boy away. However, upon looking closer, I realized he was actually helping the chick reach a hole in the wall. I wondered why the boy would want to put the chick there, and I was aghast to see a small flame beneath the opening; I feared he was trying to cast the bird into the fire. But as I peered deeper, I noticed a pile of twigs inside the hole. It was a nest.</p>

            <p>I questioned why a nest would be located inside a wall, directly above a flame. I then realized the flame came from a lamp lit as a votive to a murti of Lord Hanuman, which was set into the wall just above the hole. While I was still trying to comprehend the scene, the boy successfully placed the chick inside and ran away. Immediately, the hen flew into the hole and began brooding.</p>

            <p>I was astonished. I came to understand that this was a wild hen nesting in the dilapidated temple wall, which provided shelter and occasional food from passing pilgrims. The flame acted as a deterrent against snakes and other predators—a testament to the strange and wondrous ways Lord Hanuman protects those seeking refuge. Enlightened and humbled, I bowed to the murti and continued on my way. I later learned that the boy was part of a passing caravan and was simply returning a chick that had fallen from its perch.</p>

            <p>It was a display of a helpless chick, a protective mother, a compassionate child, a guarding fire, and a purposeful nest—all under the aegis of the Almighty. My subconscious mind had spun a web of prejudices and misconceptions, only to be corrected by the truth of a divine play. I woke up startled, scribbling down the dream for my records. Only time will tell what this truly meant.</p>
